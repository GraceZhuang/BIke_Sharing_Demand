This is repo for Kaggle project Bike Sharing Demand (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)

The objective is to predict the number of rental. Besides making prediction with regularized regression (lasso and ridge) and random forest, I also did exploratory analysis to find insights of data.  

The notebook includes everything (exploratory analysis, feature engineering, prediction etc.) for this project. This is a really quick project, just a very quick practice of data science project. Data could be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data
